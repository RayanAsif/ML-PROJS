Machine learning project for diabetes predition. 
This project uses various health parameters to determine whether a person is diabetic.
Using python libraries such as numpy , pandas for numerical and data manipulation , while implement a SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE(SVM) algo to train and test.
The file above contains a simple py jupyter notebook from Google Colab which also contains a dataset.In order to see how the project works you can go through the code.
At the end you can modify the code with your very own values to check if the algorithm has been trained accurately.
